# Recommendation System

## Overview

This project implements a simple recommendation system using microservices. The system includes two main services:

1. **Generator Service**: Generates random recommendations.
2. **Invoker Service**: Invokes the Generator Service, caches the results locally, and uses Redis for persistent caching.

The services are containerized using Docker and managed with Docker Compose.

## Services
- _Generator Service:_ Listens on port 5000. Generates a random number based on the model name and viewer ID.
- _Invoker Service:_ Listens on port 5001. Makes parallel requests to the Generator Service, caches the results, and returns them.

## Installation and Setup

### Step 1: Clone the Repository
``` plaintext
git clone https://github.com/MariaHov/Recommendation-System.git
cd Recommendation-System
```
### Step 2: Build and Run the Docker Containers

```angular2html
docker-compose up --build
```
This command will build the Docker images for both services 
and start the services and the Redis cache in Docker containers.

## Usage
### Testing the Invoker Service
You can test the Invoker Service using cURL
```angular2html
curl -X POST http://localhost:5001/recommend \
-H "Content-Type: application/json" \
-d '{"model_name": "example_model", "viewer_id": "example_user"}'
```
This will return a JSON array of recommendations generated by the Generator Service.

## Stopping the Services
To stop the running containers, use:

```angular2html
docker-compose down
```
This command will stop and remove the containers.
